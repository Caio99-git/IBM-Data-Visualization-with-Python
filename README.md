# 🚗 Data Visualization – IBM Final Project

## 📌 Short Description
This project analyzes historical automobile sales data to explore the impact of economic recessions on vehicle sales. By exploring these variables through interactive visualizations, the project provides key insights into how economic downturns affect consumer behavior and automobile market performance.

## 📈 Key Results / Insights

- **Recessions** have a significant impact on vehicle sales, with notable drops in sales during downturn periods.
- Vehicles in the **luxury segment** tend to experience sharper declines in sales compared to economy vehicles during recessions.
- **Sales trends** show that post-recession, the market rebounds slowly with some sectors recovering faster than others.
- Interactive visualizations provided insights into the year-over-year differences in vehicle sales and recession effects.
