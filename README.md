# 🚗 Data Visualization – IBM Final Project

## 📌 Short Description
This project analyzes historical automobile sales data to explore the impact of economic recessions on vehicle sales. By exploring these variables through interactive visualizations, the project provides key insights into how economic downturns affect consumer behavior and automobile market performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze historical automobile sales data
- Explore the impact of economic recessions on vehicle sales
- Create interactive visualizations to identify patterns and trends
- Provide actionable insights into how recessions affect the automobile market
- Use Python libraries like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly` for data visualization

---

## 🗂️ Data Source

- **Dataset**: [Historical Automobile Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- This dataset includes automobile sales from various years and economic periods.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – static visualizations  
- **Plotly** – interactive visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Numpy** – numerical operations

---

## 📈 Key Results / Insights

- **Recessions** have a significant impact on vehicle sales, with notable drops in sales during downturn periods.
- Vehicles in the **luxury segment** tend to experience sharper declines in sales compared to economy vehicles during recessions.
- **Sales trends** show that post-recession, the market rebounds slowly with some sectors recovering faster than others.
- Interactive visualizations provided insights into the year-over-year differences in vehicle sales and recession effects.

# 🌟 Supermarket Santa Clara Data Analysis and Visualization

Welcome to the **Supermarket Santa Clara Data Analysis and Visualization** project, a personal data science project using real sales data from the company I currently work at. This project demonstrates the complete data wrangling and visualization workflow applied to actual business data, aimed at generating insights for sales performance and decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

As a data scientist at my company, the goal is to clean, transform, and visualize sales data to better understand product performance, pricing, and profitability.  
The dataset includes features such as:

- Product codes and descriptions  
- Unit costs and prices  
- Sales volumes  
- Margins and markups  
- Total costs and sales values

---

## 📥 About The Dataset

The data comes directly from the company’s sales records, extracted from internal systems. It represents detailed transactional information used for business analysis and reporting.

## 🔍 Key Tasks

### 📊 Data Wrangling & Cleaning
- Product descriptions translated through deep translator from Google Translator
- Handled inconsistent numeric formats (Brazilian style decimals and thousands separators)
- Converted data types to enable analysis
- Identified and filtered invalid or missing data rows

### 📈 Data Visualization
- Created interactive dashboards and plots to explore sales trends
- Analyzed product-wise and category-wise sales and profitability
- Presented clear visual insights to support business decisions

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Libraries:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`  
- **Data Cleaning:** String manipulation, type conversion, missing data handling  
- **Visualization:** Static and interactive plots for exploratory data analysis
